Hey dev.to community! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to share the technical journey behind building **SketchFlow**, our collaborative visual documentation platform for development teams. In this article, I'll walk through the architecture decisions, technical challenges, and lessons learned while creating a real-time collaborative tool that combines diagramming with markdown documentation.

## The Technical Challenge

When we started building SketchFlow, we identified several key technical requirements:

1. **Real-time collaboration** with minimal latency
2. **Split-screen interface** combining diagrams and markdown
3. **Role-based access control** for team collaboration
4. **Offline capabilities** with import/export functionality
5. **Responsive design** that works across devices
6. **Scalable architecture** to support growing teams

Let's dive into how we addressed each of these challenges.

## Architecture Overview

SketchFlow is built on a modern stack:

```
Frontend:
- Next.js 14 (React framework)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- ShadcnUI (component library)
- Excalidraw (diagram editor)
- CodeMirror (markdown editor)

Backend:
- Next.js API routes
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- NextAuth.js (authentication)
- Resend (email notifications)

Infrastructure:
- Vercel (hosting)
- Vercel Postgres (database)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
```

## Real-Time Collaboration Implementation

One of our biggest challenges was implementing real-time collaboration. We explored several approaches:

1. **WebSockets**: Initially, we considered Socket.io for real-time updates
2. **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types)**: For handling concurrent edits
3. **Operational Transformation**: Another approach for managing concurrent edits

After evaluating these options, we implemented a hybrid approach:

```javascript
// Simplified collaboration setup
const setupCollaboration = (projectId, userId, role) => {
  // Connect to WebSocket
  const socket = new WebSocket(`wss://api.sketchflow.io/projects/${projectId}/collab`);
  
  // Handle incoming changes
  socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    
    // Apply changes to local state
    if (data.type === 'diagram_update') {
      updateDiagramState(data.content);
    } else if (data.type === 'markdown_update') {
      updateMarkdownState(data.content);
    }
    
    // Log activity for the activity feed
    logCollaborationActivity(data);
  };
  
  // Send local changes
  const sendChanges = debounce((changes) => {
    if (socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      socket.send(JSON.stringify(changes));
    }
  }, 100);
  
  return { sendChanges };
};
```

For the diagram editor, we integrated Excalidraw and extended it with custom collaboration features:

```javascript
// Excalidraw integration with collaboration
const DiagramEditor = ({ projectId, initialData, isCollaborator, role }) => {
  const [excalidrawData, setExcalidrawData] = useState(initialData);
  const { sendChanges } = useCollaboration(projectId);
  
  const handleChange = (elements, appState) => {
    setExcalidrawData({ elements, appState });
    
    // Only send changes if user has edit permissions
    if (isCollaborator && (role === 'EDITOR' || role === 'OWNER')) {
      sendChanges({
        type: 'diagram_update',
        content: { elements, appState },
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <Excalidraw
      initialData={excalidrawData}
      onChange={handleChange}
      viewModeEnabled={!(isOwner || (isCollaborator && role === 'EDITOR'))}
    />
  );
};
```

## Database Schema Design

Our database schema was designed to support collaboration and project organization:

```prisma
model User {
  id                      String                  @id @default(cuid())
  name                    String?
  email                   String?                 @unique
  projects                Project[]
  projectTags             ProjectTag[]
  collaborations          ProjectCollaborator[]
  invitedCollaborations   ProjectCollaborator[]  @relation("InvitedBy")
  collaborationActivities CollaborationActivity[]
  projectComments         ProjectComment[]
}

model Project {
  id               String                  @id @default(cuid())
  name             String
  description      String?
  emoji            String?
  color            String?
  userId           String
  user             User                    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  diagrams         Diagram[]
  markdowns        Markdown[]
  shared           Boolean                 @default(false)
  projectTags      ProjectTag[]
  collaborators    ProjectCollaborator[]
  activities       CollaborationActivity[]
  comments         ProjectComment[]
  originalProjectId String?
  originalProject  Project?                @relation("ProjectClones", fields: [originalProjectId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  clones           Project[]               @relation("ProjectClones")
}

// Collaboration models
model ProjectCollaborator {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  projectId    String
  userId       String
  role         Role     @default(VIEWER)
  inviteStatus Status   @default(PENDING)
  invitedBy    String
  invitedAt    DateTime @default(now())
  acceptedAt   DateTime?
  project      Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  inviter      User     @relation("InvitedBy", fields: [invitedBy], references: [id])
}
```

## API Design

We implemented a RESTful API for most operations, with WebSockets for real-time updates:

```
GET /api/projects - List user's projects
POST /api/projects - Create a new project
GET /api/projects/:id - Get project details
PUT /api/projects/:id - Update project
DELETE /api/projects/:id - Delete project

GET /api/projects/:id/collaborators - List collaborators
POST /api/projects/:id/collaborators - Invite collaborator
PUT /api/projects/:id/collaborators/:userId - Update collaborator role
DELETE /api/projects/:id/collaborators/:userId - Remove collaborator

GET /api/projects/:id/activities - Get activity feed
GET /api/projects/:id/comments - Get comments
POST /api/projects/:id/comments - Add comment
```

## Performance Optimization

Performance was a key focus, especially for the real-time collaboration features:

1. **Debounced Updates**: We implemented debouncing to prevent excessive API calls during rapid editing
2. **Selective Rendering**: Components only re-render when their specific data changes
3. **Pagination**: For projects, comments, and activity feeds to reduce initial load time
4. **Lazy Loading**: Components and data are loaded only when needed

```javascript
// Example of optimized data fetching with SWR
const useProjectData = (projectId) => {
  const { data, error, mutate } = useSWR(
    projectId ? `/api/projects/${projectId}` : null,
    fetcher,
    {
      revalidateOnFocus: false,
      dedupingInterval: 5000,
    }
  );
  
  return {
    project: data,
    isLoading: !error && !data,
    isError: error,
    mutate
  };
};
```

## Authentication and Authorization

We implemented a robust auth system using NextAuth.js with custom role-based access control:

```javascript
// Middleware to check project access
export async function checkProjectAccess(req, res, projectId) {
  const session = await getServerSession(req, res, authOptions);
  
  if (!session?.user?.id) {
    return { hasAccess: false, error: "Unauthorized" };
  }
  
  const project = await prisma.project.findUnique({
    where: { id: projectId },
    select: {
      userId: true,
      shared: true,
    },
  });
  
  if (!project) {
    return { hasAccess: false, error: "Project not found" };
  }
  
  // Check if user is a collaborator
  const collaborator = await prisma.projectCollaborator.findUnique({
    where: {
      projectId_userId: {
        projectId,
        userId: session.user.id
      }
    },
    select: {
      role: true,
      inviteStatus: true
    }
  });
  
  const isOwner = project.userId === session.user.id;
  const isCollaborator = collaborator && collaborator.inviteStatus === "ACCEPTED";
  
  return {
    hasAccess: isOwner || project.shared || isCollaborator,
    isOwner,
    isCollaborator,
    role: isCollaborator ? collaborator.role : null
  };
}
```

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

Building SketchFlow wasn't without its challenges:

1. **Concurrent Editing Conflicts**: We had to carefully design our collaboration system to handle concurrent edits without conflicts
2. **Performance with Large Diagrams**: Rendering and synchronizing large diagrams required optimization
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across browsers was challenging
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adapting a complex split-screen interface for mobile devices required creative solutions

Key lessons learned:

1. **Start with a Solid Data Model**: Our investment in a well-designed database schema paid off as we added features
2. **Incremental Feature Rollout**: We released core features first, then added collaboration capabilities
3. **User Feedback is Gold**: Early user testing helped us identify and fix usability issues
4. **Performance Matters**: Optimizing from the start is easier than retrofitting performance improvements

## What's Next for SketchFlow

We're continuing to evolve SketchFlow with exciting features on our roadmap:

1. **AI-Assisted Documentation**: Generating documentation suggestions based on diagrams
2. **Version History**: Tracking changes and allowing rollback to previous versions
3. **Advanced Permissions**: More granular access controls for enterprise teams
4. **Integration Ecosystem**: Connecting with popular development tools and platforms

## Open Source Contributions

We've benefited tremendously from open source, and we're giving back by open-sourcing several components:

1. **react-markdown-editor**: Our enhanced markdown editor with real-time preview
2. **collaboration-utils**: Utilities for implementing real-time collaboration
3. **nextjs-prisma-auth**: Our authentication and authorization patterns

## Conclusion

Building SketchFlow has been an exciting technical journey. By combining modern web technologies with thoughtful UX design, we've created a platform that's transforming how development teams document and collaborate.
