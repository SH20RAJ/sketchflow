# SketchFlow Investor Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title
**SketchFlow: Revolutionizing Visual Documentation for Development Teams**

[Logo and tagline: "Where diagrams meet documentation. Seamlessly."]

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Documentation is Broken**

* **Fragmentation**: Teams use separate tools for diagrams and text documentation
* **Synchronization**: Diagrams and explanations quickly become out of sync
* **Collaboration**: Traditional documentation tools lack real-time collaboration
* **Accessibility**: Technical concepts are hard to communicate visually
* **Maintenance**: Documentation is treated as an afterthought, not a living asset

**Result**: Knowledge silos, wasted time, and costly miscommunication

## Slide 3: Market Validation
**The Documentation Crisis in Numbers**

* 60% of developers cite inadequate documentation as their biggest challenge (Stack Overflow)
* Teams spend 25% of development time searching for information (McKinsey)
* Poor documentation extends onboarding time by 50-200% (DevOps Research)
* 78% of engineering managers identify documentation as a critical pain point (State of DevOps)
* Remote work has increased documentation needs by 35% (Upwork)

## Slide 4: Solution
**Introducing SketchFlow**

* **Split-Screen Interface**: Seamlessly combine diagrams and markdown documentation
* **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work together with role-based permissions
* **Smart Organization**: Tag-based system for easy discovery
