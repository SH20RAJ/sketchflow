Hi [First Name],

Great documentation combines clear explanations with helpful visuals. That's why we built SketchFlow's unique split-screen interface.

## Introducing the Split-Screen Experience:

[Screenshot of split-screen interface]

**Left Side: Diagram Editor**
• Create system diagrams, flowcharts, and visual models
• Use pre-built technical shapes and connectors
• Customize with colors, styles, and annotations

**Right Side: Markdown Editor**
• Write structured documentation with Markdown
• Code syntax highlighting for technical examples
• Real-time preview as you type

**Why This Matters:**
When diagrams and explanations live together, they stay in sync. No more outdated visuals or confusing references.
